## About Me
I have been starting learning programming for front-end a couple of times but haven't successeded yet. My friends were helping me, I took some free online courses but I didn't have a goal at that moment.
Currently I work as ABAP Developer at LeverX. As SAP is constantly developing, learning JS will definetely help me to lead my carier and participate in different new projects.
Or I can just requalify instead.
